Welcome to my repo demonstrating/documenting some of my python programming skills. I have 7 folders here that I have done recently. My desire is to show that I can write CLEAN EFFICIENT pyton code to solve any problem and use some of the core, well known python modules/packages/libraries. I wrote all the code minus some of the tests in the 'coursework' folder and those are labeled with authors of each.

This course was very challenging and rewarding in many many ways. I agree with the overwhelming amounts data from developer surveys that show python is an enjoyable language to code in.

My desire is to use these skills to code my RaspberryPi, maybe some desktop OS stuff, AI/ML for sure and Django Web or Flask API code projects. I am an experienced (3+ years fs web dev) develpoer and with that background can comfortably use this language as needed at an intermediate level but am stronger with JS still at the moment of making this repo in 2020.

1. A foreign exchange currency converter. CLI usage only right now.
2. Audit Data
3. My full coursework demonstrating each aspect of Python
4. Web scarper
5. Object Oriented Practice Code showing 4 core principles.
6. A Flask web API hosted on python Anywhere
7. ML Code practice

Here is a summary of the skills learned @Cornell University obtaining the certification `SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IN PYTHON`.
